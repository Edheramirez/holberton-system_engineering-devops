System Engineering Devops

Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that allows to study and understand reality, with the purpose of implementing or optimizing complex systems. It can also be seen as the technological application of systems theory to engineering efforts, adopting the systemic paradigm throughout this work. Systems engineering integrates other disciplines and specialty groups in a team effort, forming a focused development process.

Systems Engineering has, as a field of study, any existing system. For example, systems engineering can study the digestive system or the human immune system, or perhaps the tax system of a specific country. In this sense, although in some countries systems engineering is associated as only associated with computer systems, this is incorrect, since computer systems are a small part of a huge range of types and classes of systems.

Systems engineering is the application of mathematical and physical sciences to develop systems that economically use the materials and forces of nature for the benefit of humanity.

One of the main differences in systems engineering from other traditional engineering disciplines is that systems engineering does not build tangible products. While civil engineers could design buildings or bridges, electronic engineers could design circuits, systems engineers deal with abstract systems with the help of systems science methodologies, and also rely on other disciplines to design and deliver tangible products. they are the realization of those systems.
